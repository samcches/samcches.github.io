There comes a point in many people's lives when they take a step back, look at their lives and realize "This just isn't working." 

Sometimes the process is sudden, like the person who never misses a day of work waking up one day to email his boss he's taking his two weeks of vacation and putting in his two weeks' notice. Other times, it's long overdue, like the wife who realizes it's been decades since she felt anything more than indifference and duty towards her husband. 

For me, it came during a teacher-training course required for me to get my BPSS license, necessary for me to boost my $12/hour rate to $15/hour. My previous ESL certification and four years of practical experience teaching in Korea did not satisfy the DoE, and I was bouncing around the city from part-time gig to part-time gig, paying for the course out of the little I had. I lamented this to another one of the teachers in the class, while working on the WSJ's crossword.

"You should try coding," he suggested. Turns out he was an instructor at Flatiron School.

I laughed. "Technology and I rarely get along. I'm more comfortable with a quill and parchment than social media, and the copy machine always jams anytime I come near it."

He shrugged, unperturbed, as if he'd heard the same excuse a dozen times. "Give it a try. Codecademy has some pretty good free beginner stuff. See how you like it."

I remained skeptical, but created an account later that day. Three hours later, I was hooked.

It was the perfect marriage of linguistics and logic for which I'd been looking for years. And, if loving it wasn't enough, unlike teaching, it actually PAID. 

The next day in class, I sought out my new friend. "I'm in."
