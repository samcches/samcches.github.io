Everyone has different needs, just as they have different experiences and different lifestyles. In the same vein, every investment portfolio should be unique to the needs of the investor. Some feel a great deal of pride investing in locally, while for others location is not important. Those looking for solid, proven investments that continue to grow will look for the equivalents of Apple and Google to place their money, while those who find excitement in uncovering investments that have more potential will search for opportunities than have yet to show their greatest growth.

The same concepts apply to real estate investing. 

Using data from the property-selling site Zillow, I calculated the best investment opportunities in four categories: local + proven, local + potential, national + proven, and national + potential. As New York City is my home base, I used it as the local investment city. 

First (after cleaning and preprocessing the data), I isolated the data relevant to New York and committed it to a new data frame.  I then calculated which properties had the greatest and lowest growth. Then I did the same for the national database.

#### Local + Proven:
The following properties have shown to be high-growth investments in the New York metropolitan area.  
1. Brooklyn, NY	11233
2. Brooklyn, NY	11216
3. Jersey City, NJ	07306
4. Jersey City, NJ	07307
5. Noyack, NY	11963

As prices in Manhattan remain extremely high for most neighborhoods, growth opportunities nearby in Brooklyn and Jersey City are unsurprising. 

#### Local + Potential:
The following properties show that they have yet to have substantial growth and that their highest value has yet to manifest.
1. Vernon, NJ	07462
2. Highland Lake, NJ	07422
3. Dover, NY	12594
4. Vernon Valley, NJ	07418
5. Goldens Bridge, NY	10526

These locations are ideal for people who are former New Yorkers ready for less chaotic, more suburban existence. They are about an hour and a half from New York.

#### National + Proven:
The following locations have shown continued growth over the past twenty years. 
1. Candler-Mcafee (Atlanta), Georgia	30032
2. Lakeland, FL	33805
3. Nashville, TN	37210
4. Pittsburgh, PA	15201
5. Hertford, NC	27980

As many startups continue to move out of the traditional hubs of New York City and Silicon Valley and into smaller, more affordable cities, the property values continue to increase. With the growth of these companies will follow growth of real estate value.

#### National + Potential: 
These locations have greatest losses or have yet to see any marked gains over the past twenty years. 
1. Flint, MI	48506
2. Flint, MI	48503
3. Austin, TX	78735
4. Johnstown, PA	15902
5. Capron, IL	11963

The two zip codes with the greatest percent losses are both in Flint, Michigan. Considering the poisoning of the local water source in 2014, this is unsurprising. It does, however, show great potential for companies with a strong philanthropic drive and long-term vision. If a company or coalition of companies invested in rehabilitating Flint and other cities suffering from similar problems, the long-term financial profits and moral reward would be significant.

Just as in stock and bond investing, real estate portfolios ought to reflect the specific needs of their clients. Each of these four diverse options, and selections from each, can provide real estate investors with portfolios suited to their investment timeframe, circumstances, and goals.
